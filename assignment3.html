  <UL>
    <ul>
        <li> The first step is laying the foundation by building up the flavour</li>
       <li>sauteeing the onions which should about 3 to 5 minutes</li>
      <li>  The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste</li>
      <dt>This adds a deep and rich tomato flavour</dt>
</ul>
<ul>
   <li>Add the blended pepper and stir to mix</li>
   <dt>Usually,there is until it becomes really thick and the oil literally flows on it.</dt>
   <li>Add the thyme,curry,white pepper[if you wish] and the seasoning cubes</li>
   <dt>Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to.</dt>
   <li>once the flavour is on point,then add the rice</li>
   <dt>Make sure to srir the rice properly until the each grains of rice is covered with the sauce</dt>
   <li>Now pour enough water in the pot and add the chicken stock</li>
   <li>Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight fitting lid</li>
   <dt>If the lid is not fitting enough,cover it with a foil paper before covering it with the lid</dt>
   <dt>This is because Jollof rice needs a lot steam in order to turn out well </dt>
   <li>once the rice comes to a boil,reduce the heat to medium low and continue to cook until the rice is done about 20 to 25 minutes</li>
   <li>Serve with fried chicken</li>
</ul>
